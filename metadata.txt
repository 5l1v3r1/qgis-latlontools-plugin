about=
    Lat Lon Tools makes it easy to capture, zoom to coordinates, and interact with other on-line mapping tools. It adds MGRS support to QGIS. When working with Google Earth, Google Maps or other on-line mapping tools, coordinates are specified in the order of 'Latitude, Longitude'. By default Lat Lon Tools uses the standard Google Map format, but is very flexible and can use virtually any projection and coordinate format for input and output. The plugin has the following tools. 
    1) Capture coordinates to the clipboard (in any projection) when the user clicks on the map.
    2) Zoom to and highlight a point on the map using coordinates from any projection, including MGRS, and can format the coordinates in decimal, DMS, or WKT POINT notation.
    3) Launch and display an external map based on the coordinate clicked on.
    4) Use a list of points for rapid zooming created from a file, direct input, or captured from the map. Create a point layer from these locations.
    5) MGRS conversion routines that converts a layer with an MGRS field into a point layer, and creates an MGRS field from the point layer.
    Lat Lon Tools makes it possible to seamlessly copy and paste between QGIS, Google Earth, and other on-line maps. The user can specify the delimiter used between coordinates and whether the coordinate order is 'Latitude, Longitude (Y,X)' or 'Longitude, Latitude (X,Y)'.
