This converts ASCII coordinates found in one or two fields into a new point geometry layer. If the coordinates are numeric and are in two fields, then the default QGIS importer can be used. This importer supports formats not available by the QGIS importer such as DMS, MGRS, Plus Codes, and X & Y (latitude & longitude) coordinates that are in a single field separated by a separator.

Select the input coordinate type which may be found in one or two fields. Decimal and DMS coordinates can be in one or two fields, but MGRS and Plus Code coordinates are always in one field. When DMS or Decimal coordinates are in 1 field select which order the X & Y (latitude & longitude) coordinates are in. The order is important if the hemisphere indicators N,S,E,W are not present. The column 'Select second field longitude (x) coordinate' is used when the coordinates are in two fields.
