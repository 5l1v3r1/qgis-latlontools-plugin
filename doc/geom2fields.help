This takes a point vector layer and creates a new layer with the layer's latitude, longitude (Y, X) copied into one or two text fields in the new layer. The user has a lot of flexibility as to the output format. For Wgs84 the output can be in decimal degrees or DMS. Other formats include GeoJSON, WKT, MGRS, UTM, and Plus Codes.
